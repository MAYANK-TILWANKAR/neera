                &quot;Neera: The Guest House&quot; was born from a desire to
                create a space that feels like home for travelers seeking both
                comfort and a deeper connection with Ujjain&apos;s spiritual
                essence. We chose the term &quot;Guest House&quot; to emphasize
                our commitment to providing a warm, welcoming environment, much
                like the traditional Indian concept of &apos;Atithi Devo
                Bhava&apos; (Guest is God).

                A guest house offers a more personal touch, where every visitor
                is treated as a cherished guest in our home. Our name,
                &quot;Neera,&quot; inspired by the purity of water, reflects the
                calm and refreshing experience we strive to offer each guest.

              <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed hidden md:block">
                Our aim is to create a sanctuary where you feel more like a
                guest in a loved one&apos;s home, surrounded by care and
                tranquility. Our goal is to make you feel like a special guest
                in a loved ones home, with plenty of care and peace.
